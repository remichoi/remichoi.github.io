Hello! I am a first-year Ph.D. student at [School of Computing and Information, University of Pittsburgh](https://www.sci.pitt.edu/), advised by Dr. [Malihe Alikhani](https://www.malihealikhani.com/). I earned my B.S. in Computer Science from University of Maryland, College Park with a focus in Psychology. Before entering graduate school, I was a data scientist at [Chartmetric](https://chartmetric.com/) where I got to revamp our global ranking algorithm and write [this article](https://blog.chartmetric.com/cross-platform-performance-cpp-global-digital-artist-ranking/). 

I'm currently exploring the research question of bridging gaps in NLP via grounding {visually, linguistically, socially}. As someone also interested by social psychology and behavioral economics, I'm excited by the idea of bringing together various human behaviors and NLP models for more human-like AI.

Right now, I am working on projects to better understand human cognitions and behaviors in collaboration with colleagues from Linguistics, Child Psychology, and Cognitive Science.
