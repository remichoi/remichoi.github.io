Hello! I am a first-year Ph.D. student at [School of Computing and Information, University of Pittsburgh](https://www.sci.pitt.edu/), advised by Dr. [Malihe Alikhani](https://www.malihealikhani.com/). I earned my B.S. in Computer Science from University of Maryland, College Park with a focus in Psychology. 

My research interests span natural language processing and cognitive science. Currently, I am studying **Multimodal NLP and its uses in understanding human cognition and behavior**, while  collaborating with colleagues in Linguistics, Child Psychology, and Cognitive Science.
